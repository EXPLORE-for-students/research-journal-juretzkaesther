    "![This code loops over a set of simulation snapshots and reads in dark matter particle data for each one. For every snapshot, the particles are sorted by their unique IDs so that a fixed reference set of LMC particle IDs can be efficiently matched. The coordinates of the matched LMC particles are then extracted and stored, allowing the same particles to be tracked consistently across multiple snapshots.](images/code_for_loop_snap.png)\n",
