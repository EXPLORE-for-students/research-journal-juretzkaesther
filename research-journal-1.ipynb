     So, the group is looking at how this interaction might change the dark matter distribution of the MW over time."

    "The scientific paper [1] focused on what the DM density profile near Galactic Center might look like as there was an 'unexplained excess of gamma rays'[1],
    called Fermi GeV excess. That rises the question whether the GeV excess could be due to DM annihilation. Overall, is the goal to derive implications
    for indirect DM searches.

    "Simulations that try to explain the Fermi GeV excess use three important criterias:
     - Rotation Curve fits well the observed MW kinematical data \n
     - Total stellar mass within 3𝜎 range of MW \n
     - Substantial stellar disc component \n
    Key results of simulations are: \n
    - Inner 1.5 – 2 kpc: \n
	> - the amount of DM increases slower when compared to NFW profile \n
	> - flattening: less DM in inner region than expected \n
    - 1.5 – 6 or 8 kpc:\n
	> - DM density profile is steeper \n
	> - DM becomes more concentrated \n
    - Outermost regions well described \n
